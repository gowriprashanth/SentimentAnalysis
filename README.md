# Sentiment Analysis System

## Introduction

In the digital age, businesses generate vast amounts of unstructured text data through various channels. This project addresses the need for efficient sentiment analysis by developing a cloud-based system that processes and analyzes text data from multiple sources.

## Project Description

The project aims to develop a scalable, secure, and cost-effective sentiment analysis system. It processes text data, including images with embedded text, to determine sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral). Real-time analysis empowers businesses with data-driven decision-making, improved customer experience, and strategic reputation management.

## Problem Statement

Challenges addressed:
- Volume of unstructured text data
- Complexity of natural language
- Need for real-time analysis
- High cost of sentiment analysis infrastructure
